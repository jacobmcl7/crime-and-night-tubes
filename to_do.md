to do list:

next things to do:
 - deal with the fact some lines didn't go the whole way
 - check the new data construction is done properly (MOST IMPORTANT)
 - get in the appropriate covariates - e.g. region and station properties
    - while doing this, maybe undo the splitting of files for the geocoding - we don't need to do this

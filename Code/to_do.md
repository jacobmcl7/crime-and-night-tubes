to do list:

things to do:
 - deal with the fact some lines didn't go the whole way
 - define treatment!!
 - maybe split the data extraction into pre and post ArcGIS
 - check the new data construction is done properly (MOST IMPORTANT)
 - maybe undo the splitting of files for the geocoding - we don't need to do this
